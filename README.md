Use the FinalPipeline.ipynb to run the pipeline. The detectionTracking.ipynb file contains the script to run just the detection and tracking pipeline. The lane_det.py file can be used to run the Lane Detection model (change the file paths accordingly). To run this script however, follow the setup steps in the FinalPipeline.ipynb file. The pre-trained model weight files are in the original repositories.
